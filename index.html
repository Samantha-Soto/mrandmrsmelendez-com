A friend of ours had introduced us, it was the first football game of the season. It's going to sound strange and slightly crazy but I remember him wearing a grey Batman shirt. First thing I had realized was his nose haha. We all know its pretty big. I didn't find the man attractive, but then again I was a freshman and had so many things on my mind. After that day we ended up bumping into each other everywhere. It was crazy. The more and more I saw this man, I started to develop feelings for him. He became my best friend, and eventually after that became my boyfriend. So many memories I have with this man. I knew I wanted him to be my only in life. Who would have ever thought that at the age of 15 I knew I wanted to be with him forever. Till this day the feeling I have for him has not change, I have found the man I love, care and adore for. He is the one who makes me smile, crazy and happy all at the same time. He has blessed me with two beautiful children. A daughter who is a reflection of her father. A son who will forever carry his name. He will forever be the man I look forward to marrying."

    <p class="jp">"My life began and ended in 2009. Just kidding. I actually ended up meeting my soul mate during that year. I didn’t know, but from that day forward we would embark on a lifelong journey. We went from being immature children to being mature adults overnight. As time progressed and conditions changed with the births of Mya and Anthony, the one thing that stayed the same was our ability to never give up on each other during tough transition periods in our lives. She has been my rock and has somehow kept me grounded for the most part. To be honest without her I would probably still be making horrible decisions. She has always showed me unconditional love and that means the world to me. Even during some of the toughest times in my life she has always been by my side and never judged me.  Although we are already married, this day will be very special to us. It is a day where we can solidify our bond in marriage in front of all of our friends and family."
